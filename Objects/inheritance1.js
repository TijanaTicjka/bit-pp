/* Employees and Managers
1. Create constructor functions with properties representing the following:
○ Person: name, surname
○ Employee: inherits Person and has job and salary
○ Developer: inherits from Employee and has specialization
○ Manager: inherits from Employee and has department
2. All developers should inherit method:
○ getSpecialization which prints out the name of the specialization
3. All managers should inherit methods:
○ getDepartment which prints out the name of the department
○ changeDepartment which sets the department value to the given value
4. All employees should inherit methods:
○ getData which returns the name, surname and salary
○ getSalary which prints out the salary
○ increaseSalary which increases the salary by 10% */
